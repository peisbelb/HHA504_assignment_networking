*Azure* 


To create a virtual network through Azure, first, we will need to access the Virtual Networks service provided on the Azure website and click "Create virtual network"

For the purposes of this assignment, we will leave the subscription as Azure for Students and leave the security portion disabled. We are able to see the IP addresses (address space and Subnet) in the image below. After reviewing the virtual network, we will be able to create the VN. Be aware, it may take some time to deploy the virtual network.

After the deployment is complete, you will be able to see the overview of the VN. This tab will provide the start time, correlation ID, as well as other useful information.

Lastly, under the Overview tab, we will be able to toggle to "capabilities" and see what can be configured to the VN. Some options include: DDoS protection, Azure Firewall, Peerings, and Private endpoints. These features would be able to further enhance the VN in Azure.

*GCP*

In GCP, we will see that similar to Azure, we will be able to create a Virtual Network (in GCP it is labled as VPC networks). We will leave the MTU as 1460 and the mode will be labled as custom.

Once deployed, we will be able to see the features of the VPC network. Under the overview, we see information such as MTU (maximum transission unit), VPC network ULA internal IPv6 range, Subnet creation mode, etc.
